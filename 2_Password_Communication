### Step 1: After logged in successfully to the remote host will login to the root user using below command 
[source,bash]
$ sudo su -

### Step 2: Will go to the sshd file and set password authentication to yes
[source,bash]
$ vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!
#PasswordAuthentication yes
#PermitEmptyPasswords no
PasswordAuthentication yes           # Change to yes

### Step 3: Restart the sshd service
[source,bash]
$ systemctl restart sshd

### Step 4: Set the password to the centos user
[source,bash]
$ passwd root

Now we can access our instance without using key
